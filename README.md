My first IBM AI agent is like a smart health buddy that learns from patient data. It uses machine learning to track patterns in blood pressure, sugar levels, and heart rate. 
If something looks unusual, it predicts possible risks and sends alerts. 
It also gives personalized tips like when to take medicines or adjust lifestyle habits. Over time, it keeps learning from past data to make better recommendations, just like how Netflix learns your movie taste.
